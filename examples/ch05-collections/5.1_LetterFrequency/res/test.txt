Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
With all triumphant splendour on my brow;
But out, alack, he was but one hour mine,
The region cloud hath mask’d him from me now …

‘Full many a glorious morning have I seen’: 
Sonnet 33 is, without doubt, one of the more 
famous of Shakespeare’s Sonnets. It is also 
one of the most beautiful poems in English.

The extended metaphor whereby ‘sun = Fair Youth’ 
in this poem is intended to pay homage to the young 
man’s beauty: he shines as brightly as that heavenly 
orb. Shakespeare piles on the flattery, though, 
with extra touches: the sun has a ‘sovereign eye’ 
and so, by association, has the Fair Youth – 
‘sovereign’ suggesting royalty or at least nobility. 
The words ‘golden’, ‘gilding’, and ‘alchemy’ all 
reinforce this association with wealth and nobility.
