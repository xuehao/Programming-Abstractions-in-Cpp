# CS101: Programming Abstractions in C++

[**CS101: Programming Abstractions in C++**](https://cs101.stickmind.com/) is an introduction to computer science, inspired by Stanford CS106 series. In particular, this course starts with C++ and contains topics which could be found in a typical CS1 / CS2 course.

This repo contains a *CMake-version* source code for the excellent book [**Programming Abstractions in C++**](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/books/ProgrammingAbstractionsInC++/) written by Eric Roberts.

## Notes

All projects depend on the `SimpleCxxLib` library. For convenience, the library files are automatically downloaded for each project.

You can check the library here: [The Simple C++ Libraries](https://cppdoc.stickmind.com/)
